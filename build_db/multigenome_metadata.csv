A single ear from a given plot was harvested at (each of) 12,  24, and 36 DAP. Immediately after harvest, whole ears were frozen in liquid nitrogen. The ears were stored at _80 degrees C until kernels could be removed from the still-frozen ears, placed in test tubes, and maintained at _80 degrees C."
