<p>The qTeller web interface, as well as the RNA-seq <i>analysis</i> (as opposed to <a href="rna_data_sources.php">the raw data itself</a>) and syntenic gene sets avaliable through this website were created by <a href="http://genomevolution.org/wiki/index.php/User:Jschnable">James Schnable</a>. So he's the person you should bother with questions, concerns, suggestions, and bug reports.</p>
<p>Addie Thompson in the Muehlbauer lab at the University of Minnesota was instrumental in the creation of qTeller, providing the perspective of an actual practicing geneticist cloning real QTLs.</p>
<p>The raw data used to measure gene expression in qTeller is a result of the hard work (and hard won funding) of a whole bunch of people throughout the maize community. The source of every dataset qTeller is built upon is identified <a href="rna_data_sources.php">here</a>, and they all deserve countless thanks.</p>
<p>qTeller is currently hosted in <a href="http://microscopy.berkeley.edu/~freeling/">the Freeling Lab</a> at UC-Berkeley.</p>
